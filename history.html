         <p> Jermaine Lamarr Cole (born January 28, 1985), better known by his 
    stage name J. Cole, is an American hip hop recording artist and record producer. 
    Raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Cole initially gained recognition as a rapper 
    following the release of his debut mixtape, The Come Up, in early 2007. Intent on further 
    pursuing a solo career as a rapper, he would go on to release two additional mixtapes after signing 
    to Jay Z's 
    Roc Nation imprint in 2009.</p> </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4"  <p> Cole released his debut studio album, 
  Cole World: The Sideline Story, in 2011. It debuted at number one on the U.S. 
  Billboard 200, and was soon certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[2] 
  His next two releases, 2013's Born Sinner and 2014's 2014 Forest Hills Drive, received mostly positive reviews from 
  critics,[3][4][5] while being both certified platinum in the US. The latter earned him his first Grammy Award nomination 
  for Best Rap Album. 2014 Forest Hills Drive was also the first rap album in over 25 years to gain platinum certification without
  any guest appearances or features.[6] </p> </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4" <p>Self-taught on piano, Cole also acts as a producer alongside his hip hop career, 
producing singles for artists such as Kendrick Lamar and Janet Jackson, as well as handling the majority of the 
production in his own projects.[7] He has also developed other ventures, including Dreamville Records, as well as non-profit 
organization, the Dreamville Foundation.[8] The Dreamville Foundation isn't the only non-profit gesture Cole has put forth. In 
January 2015, Cole decided to house single mothers rent free in his childhood home, 2014 Forest Hills Drive, Fayetteville, North 
Carolina.[9] </p> </div>
