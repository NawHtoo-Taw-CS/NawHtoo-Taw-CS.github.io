   <img src="http://netstorage.metrolyrics.com/albums/5257999jpg.jpg" alt="Mountain View" style="width:300px;height:300px;">
   <div class="boxed">2014 Forest Hills Drive is the third studio album <br>by American hip hop recording artist J. Cole. 
     It <br>was released on December 9, 2014, by Dreamville <br>Records, ByStorm Entertainment, Roc Nation and <br>Columbia Records.
     [4] Recording sessions took <br>place over the whole year, while the production on <br>the album was primarily handled by Cole himself, 
     <br>along with several others such as Illmind, Vinylz, <br>Phonix Beats and Willie B. It was announced three <br>weeks before its release and 
     had very little marketing,<br> with no singles or promotion taking place prior to its release. <br>The album was supported by four 
     singles: "Apparently", <br>"Wet Dreamz", "No Role Modelz" and "Love Yourz".</div>
